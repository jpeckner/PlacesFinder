// Views with poorly-contrasting colors (such as navy-blue text on a black background) are a particularly nefarious bug.
// This can occur when the app's hard-coded colors don't mix with colors sent from the API, or if the app's hard-coded
// colors don't mix with themselves (due to programmer error).
//
// To help solve this, each distinct view in the app (typically a full-screen view, but also stand-alone views like the
// nav bar and tab bar) is styled with exactly one AppColoringProtocol. This intentionally forces us- as well as whoever
// manages colors sent from the API- to think about each view's colors holistically. While it can't eliminate the
// possibility of incompatible colors, it does greatly reduce the risk.
